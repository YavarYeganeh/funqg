**FunQG** is a novel graph coarsening framework specific to molecular data, utilizing functional groups based on a graph-theoretic concept called quotient graph. FunQG can accurately complete various molecular property prediction tasks with a significant parameters reduction. By experiments, this method significantly outperforms previous baselines on various datasets, besides its low computational complexity.
